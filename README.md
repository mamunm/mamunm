### Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Osman Mamun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/osman-mamun/), passionate about everything machine learning and materials science!

[]( ![Profile views](https://gpvc.arturio.dev/mamunm) )

- ðŸ§ª I'm currently working as a data scientist in Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Natural Language Processing, statistical inference, and Bayesian probablity theory.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning code development, applications of machine learning to various high impact scientific applications, and applications of natural language processing to solve challenging problems.

Thanks for finding yourself at my Github page! I treat Github like my second website and am constantly updating readmes and projects that I am currently invloved in.

- ðŸ§ª I'm currently working on ML methods (mostly graph and language models) for chemical and materials discovery with [Kebotix Inc](https://www.kebotix.com/) (Boston MA, USA). I work remotely from Toronto/Waterloo at the moment.
- ðŸ¤– On my own time I'm working on a project with [Kevin Shen](https://github.com/kshen3778) involving - at an oversimplified level - a meta-leraning heuristic using neural networks to generate their own weights.
- âŒ› Recently, [Don Townsend](https://github.com/townofdon) and I started a new project to build an app for virtual queues with an RL engine to optimize for fairness and efficiency of services simultaneously.
- â˜• I'd love to collaborate on any related projects or any compelling ideas that I can take up, or just chat and answer questions about stuff outside programming.
